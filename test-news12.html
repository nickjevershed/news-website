							<p>People could save up to $20 a kg if they purchased their meat from markets or grocery stores rather than the big two supermarkets, a purchasing test by Guardian Australia has revealed.</p><p>We recently bought a range of cuts and seafood in Melbourne, all on the same day, from Queen Victoria Market, Famous Halal Quality Meat &amp; Groceries in Footscray, independent Peter&rsquo;s Meats in Brunswick and nearby Woolworths and Coles supermarkets in Barkly Square.</p><p>Starting with lamb cutlets, the cheapest was Famous Halal Quality Meat &amp; Groceries, where they cost $19.99 a kg. Next was Queen Victoria Market, where stalls had lamb cutlets priced between $27.99 and $29.99. The same product was $35 a kg at Coles on special, down from the regular price of $43, which was the same as Woolworths. Peter&rsquo;s Meats was $39.</p><p>An older lady in purple-pink with shopping bags at a meat market View image in fullscreen Felicity shopping at Queen Victoria Market. &lsquo;I know if I get packaged bacon it&rsquo;s full of water &ndash; this is better quality,&rsquo; she says.

Some Australians are avoiding red meat to save money during the cost-of-living crisis, while others have stopped eating fish. But buying products at the local market could also help, our shopping trip on a recent Thursday suggests.</p><p> As part of our search, we also purchased four T-bone steaks (Famous Halal Quality Meat &amp; Groceries does not carry them). The market was the cheapest at $22.99 a kg, while Woolworths, Coles and Peter&rsquo;s Meats were $30 a kg.</p><p>Chicken breast bucked the trend by coming in at least 50 cents cheaper at the supermarkets &ndash; costing $14 a kg at both Woolworths and Coles. This was followed by Peter&rsquo;s Meats ($14.50), Famous Halal Quality Meat &amp; Groceries ($15.50) and the markets ($15.99).</p><p>Cost of living and the increase in shoppers at Flemington Market.
