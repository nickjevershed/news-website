							People could save up to $20 a kg if they purchased their meat from markets or grocery stores rather than the big two supermarkets, a purchasing test by Guardian Australia has revealed. We recently bought a range of cuts and seafood in Melbourne, all on the same day, from Queen Victoria Market, Famous Halal Quality Meat &amp; Groceries in Footscray, independent Peter&rsquo;s Meats in Brunswick and nearby Woolworths and Coles supermarkets in Barkly Square.

						<p> Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries of South America except Chile.[19] They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes,[14] as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.[7]</p>
