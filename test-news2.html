						<p aria-hidden="true" class="nah">Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries of South America except Chile.[19] They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes,[14] as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.[7]</p>

						<p aria-hidden="true" class="nah">Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are fairly common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.[20] In 2011, one specimen was spotted on the Central Coast of California.[21] These escaped populations occur in areas where prehistoric capybaras inhabited; late Pleistocene capybaras inhabited Florida[22] and Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites in California and Hydrochoerus gaylordi in Grenada, and feral capybaras in North America may actually fill the ecological niche of the Pleistocene species.[23]</p>

						<p aria-hidden="true" class="nah">Like its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy.[30]</p>

                        <p>Australia has taken the first steps to nominating parts of Cape York for recognition as Unesco world heritage.</p>

                        <p>The area features 17,000 year-old rock art &ndash; some of the world&rsquo;s largest &ndash; and is home to more than 300 threatened species, including the green sawfish, Cape York rock wallaby and southern cassowary.</p>
                        
						<p aria-hidden="true" class="nah">The maximum lifespan of the capybara is 8 to 10 years,[31] but in the wild capybaras usually do not live longer than four years because of predation from South American big cats such as jaguars and pumas and from non-mammalian predators such as eagles, caimans, and green anacondas.</p>

						<p aria-hidden="true" class="nah">Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,[14][24] as well as fruit and tree bark.[15] They are very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[26] Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.[25] The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.[27] Capybaras are autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] Like other rodents, a capybara's front teeth grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;[19] their cheek teeth also grow continuously.[27]</p>

						<p>The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and Queensland premier, Steven Miles, announced on Thursday they had placed the &ldquo;cultural landscapes&rdquo; of seven national parks on the country&rsquo;s tentative list.</p>

                        <p>It represents sites the Australian government considers to be &ldquo;cultural and/or natural heritage of outstanding universal value and therefore suitable for inscription on the world heritage list.&rdquo; Sites must be on the tentative list for a year before they can be submitted for full listing.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;This is monumental. It is the first step towards Queensland&rsquo;s incredible Cape York Peninsula being formally recognised on the world heritage list,&rdquo; Miles said.</p>
                    
                        <p>&ldquo;The first time world heritage listing was raised for Cape York was about 42 years ago, when the International Union for the Conservation of Nature said this place is so special, it deserves global recognition,&rdquo; Plibersek said.</p>
