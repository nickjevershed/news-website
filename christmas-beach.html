                        <p>Wondering whether to pack a poncho or sunhat for carols? Locking in plans for a picnic or pool party on 25 December?</p>

                        <p>Some media outlets are already offering a Christmas Day forecast – nearly three weeks out from the festivities – but is it too early to rely on the festive weather forecast?</p>
                        
                        <p>Any weather forecast more than 10 days ahead is basically “rubbish”, says Dr Martin Jucker, an atmospheric scientist and senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Monash University meteorologist Dr Michael Barnes agrees. “A day ahead, we’re pretty sure. Seven days ahead we’re not so sure. Beyond seven to 10 days, we have no idea.”</p>
                        
                        <p>Barnes, who is based at the ARC Centre of Excellence for 21st Century Weather, says future weather conditions are sensitive to the current state of the atmosphere, so predictions become less accurate the further out in time you go.	</p>
                        
                        <p>“Everyone’s hanging out for the Christmas forecast,” says Jonathan How, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology.</p>
                        
                        <p>It’s still too early, he says, advising people to check in on 18 December.</p>
